# This is for a graph class

I will find feature channels for users given a depth and a starting point.

ex: python setup.py install && graphFeaturedChannels -rootChannel stefbot -depth 4

Next: count how many times a node is pointed to and color scale it.

You need to install graphviz and rsvg-view-3 if you want to visualize large svg files.
